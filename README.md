# J124 Final Project: A Data Analysis and Visualization of Long COVID in the United States
## By Piper Melnick
### Data Analysis Process
*  Start by downloading the 9link9 post-COVID conditions dataset from the CDC and then uploading to google drive and opening in google sheets<br>

_These are 5 analysis questions on the dataset and a step-by-step guide on how to recreate them_ <br>
<br>
**Question 1: Which state had the highest percentage of adults affected by long COVID?** <br>
**_Step-by-step Answer:_** <br>
<br>
1. Filter the main sheet so it only contains data pertaining to states, and filter the indicator to only contain "Ever experienced long COVID, as a percentage of all adults" <br>

2. Then paste the filtered data into a new sheet in the workbook to edit<br>

3. Use the formula depicted below to find the average percentage of adults affected from each phase, and then copy and paste the formula to find the average for each state <br>

4. Create a new column of these averages by copy and pasting "value only" (this way the functions won't be affected during sorting). I then moved the decimal point to the tenth for easier viewing, and then filtered the sheet by the average percentage to exclude any blanks. <br>

5. Finally, sort the sheet by the non-function average column from Z-A. <br>

**The state with the highest percentage of adults affected by long COVID is West Virginia**<br>
